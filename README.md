Another container framework based on jails, to run FreeBSD containers on FreeBSD.
Every running instance is called "pot" and is more powerful than a typical container, but less flexible than a VM.
It's heavily based on FreeBSD, in particular on jails, ZFS, pf and rctl.
It will be a mixture of shell scripts and, possibly, some tools written in a proper programming language..
It's an educational/experimental project, but it can evolve in something better, more reliable

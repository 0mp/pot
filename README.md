pot
===

Another container framework based on jails.
Every running instance is called "pot" and is more powerful than a docker container, but less flexible than a VM.
It's heavily based on FreeBSD, in particular on jails + ZFS + pf.
It will be a mixture of shell scripts and, possibly, some tools written in Rust.
It's an educational project, but it can evolve in something better
